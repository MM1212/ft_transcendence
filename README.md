## Description

Welcome to the repository of our last 42 common core project!
The aim of this project was to create a social network to be used by 42 students. We wanted to give it a little twist and make it fun for everyone to interact with each other, so we decided to give birth to our lovely, Dojo Pong!
In Dojo Pong, the students of 42 can join a lobby in penguin form and be there with their friends! They can buy items, play pong, talk to each other on the chat, create chat groups, have a ranking for some competitiveness and much more!
Check it out and have fun!

## Features

### Lobby

In the lobby you can show off your style! Put on your best outfit and make everyone jealous with your swag.

### Pong

The pong game can be played in the old classical way, OR you can play it differently! You can play it with Special Powers!
The special powers are:
- Fire -> which shoots a fireball, that when it hits the ball, pushes the ball back to your paddle and gives you a cannon to shoot the ball
- Ice -> which shoots a iceball, that when it hits the other player's paddle, slows it, and if the player gets hit again a short amount of time, the paddle will freeze!
- Bubble -> which shoots a bubble, that when it hits the ball, reflects based on the collision point and increases the ball's speed. You can shoot a lot of them at the same time! eheh
- Spark -> which shoots a reverse ball, that when it hits the other player's paddle, it will invert it's controls.
- Ghost -> which shoots a cute ghost, that when it hits any object on the field, it will make it disappear for a short amount of time.
You also have mana and energy that regenerates over time! Use it wisely!

### Chat

In the chat, you can talk to EVERYONE. Chat with who you like. Block who you don't. Send images and gifs. Send invites for Pong. Change some memes with your good friends. Create a group for you and your friends to arrange some pong matches. The chat is yours to use!

### Profile

In the profile you can find all the user's information. You can text them, see their stats, their ranking and the match history.

### Ranking System

The ranking every player starts with is 1000. Every loss and win will take or give points to the player. The amount of points will be based on the difference of points between the players.
